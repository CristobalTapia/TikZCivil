TikZCivil
=========

This project aims at building a big set of Tikz Drawing, that are useful for the creation of Reports in Civil Engineering.  The main topics are: Structural Analysis and Geomechanics at the moment, since those are the kind of drawing I need at the time (I am still studying).

With this packages you are able to draw frames, retaining walls or many other types of simple structure-models for your LaTeX reports or calc-sheets.

#1. Installation
##1.1. Linux:
To install this package on a Linux system, you only need to run the installer located in the "Instal.sh" file. It will place the needed files in a texmf directory on your $HOME folder. Then it will update the latex database with texhash.

##1.2. Windows:
I'll do this when I have the time. I don't use windows with latex too much, and I don't know how to program an installation script in windows :S .
