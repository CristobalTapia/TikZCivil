TikZCivil
=========

This project aims at building a big set of Tikz Drawing, that are useful for the creation of Reports in Civil Engineering.  The main topics are: Structural Analysis and Geomechanics at the moment, since those are the kind of drawing I need at the time (I am still studying).

With this packages you are able to draw frames, retaining walls or many other types of simple structure-models for your LaTeX reports or calc-sheets.
