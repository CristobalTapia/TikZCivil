TikZCivil
=========

This project aims at building a big set of TikZ Drawing, that are useful for the creation of Reports in Civil Engineering.  The main topics are: Structural Analysis and Geomechanics at the moment, since those are the kind of drawing I need at the time (I am still studying).

With this packages you are able to draw frames, retaining walls or many other types of simple structure-models for your LaTeX reports or calc-sheets.

#1. Installation
##1.1. Linux:
To install this package on a Linux system, you only need to run the installer located in the "_Instal.sh_" file. It will place the needed files in a texmf directory on your $HOME folder. Then it will update the latex database with texhash.

##1.2. Windows 7:
To install this package in Windows 7 you need to run the python script "Install_Win7.py". This will copy the needed files to the texmf directory in the user folder (~texmf). It will then update the tex database with "_initexmf_". Remember to add the folder to your Miktex root-dir list.
